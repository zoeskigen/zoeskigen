## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Zoe (they/them)

I am an incoming third-year at Pomona College where I am majoring in Mathematics/Statistics and minoring in Data Science. 

I am passionate and knowledgeable about sabermetric analytics and am broadly interested in all things R&D.

Currently, I am developing a DIII Stuff+, Pitching+, and Location+ model using linear weights.
